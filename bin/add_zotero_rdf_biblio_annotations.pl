# Script to read in Zotero bibliographic information (RDF) and create annotations for NextStrain that link individual virus names back to the most suitable (as defined by manual override or earliest date) publication that references them.
# This script will strip all of the existing references out of the annotations file and replace them, so that the entire collection can be reconciled with the latest bibliographic information (e.g. a sample can have a pre-print URL, but then eventually
# this gets replaced with a paper URL, and we don't want to have to remove the old prepirnt URL manully (since it's a 1:1 relationship for now for sample:paper_url).
